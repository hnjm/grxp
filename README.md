## Description

App manages expenses for a group of people. It automatically takes care of previous settlements and redistribution of expenses among the group, internally. It is scaled for small to medium groups of people and greatly simplifies the money management within a group.

It is generic enough to account for various expense types like :
* a single person paying for entire group
* a single person paying for somebody else
* some people paying for the entire group
* some people paying for some other people

Trips can be easily managed with the application. People can be added and their expenses tracked on the go.

## Technical details

Runs on the Android 2.2 Platform (Froyo) and API Level 8.

## Technologies

* Android
* Java
* SQLite
